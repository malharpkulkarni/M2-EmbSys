 Here when system starts gas sensor will go high and the mode one of the Kitchen chimney starts and fan starts rotating here I used Servo as a fan earler motor was in horizontal direction when the system starts it will be vertical this indicates fan is on  and mode one indicates fan will be moving slow that we can see in LED delay of 2 seconds here I used LED as a gas sensor if LED is high than we need to assume that gas sensor is high.

Here if the smoke is more than we need to shift to the second mode and fan will start rotating fast comparingly mode 1 this we can see through LED delay here delay is 1 second and in third mode also fan will start rotating faster than 2 amd LED delay will be 0.5 second.
